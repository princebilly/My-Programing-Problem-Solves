# A Note about Multiset

## FEATURE:

1. Allows duplicate values 
2. always sorted  
3. Items once inserted in a set can't be modified but it can be removed.  
4. Typically implemented as a binary search tree  

Iterator and other things are same as set 

but instead of using the keyword "set" we will use "multiset"
